However, Afflishop expressly reserves the right to set the "upper price limit” for the marketplace as a whole, or on a per vendor basis. Vendors with marketplace track records of greater merit (including, e.g., lower refund rates, better purchaser reviews, higher ratings, longevity, etc.) may be afforded greater latitude in pricing their products, at Afflishop’s discretion. You understand that as a vendor, you are subject to the foregoing price limits unless you have been expressly notified in writing from Afflishop. Afflishop will review each petition for a price limit raise on a case by case basis, and may accept or decline the petition in its sole discretion.<br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing price limits, Afflishop also reserves the right to raise the upper price limit on a per product basis (i.e. for a particular product from a specific vendor) based on Afflishop’s direct review (“price review”) which may include consideration of the vendor’s history in the marketplace, reputation in the industry, the product itself, the proposed price, market conditions, current terms and relationships with payment processors, gateways, and such other factors as Afflishop chooses. After such price review, Afflishop’s decision as to whether to raise the upper price limit in any instance shall be final and made in its sole discretion.

Thus, you expressly grant permission to Afflishop to sell your products, and to process payments received from the sale of your product(s) in the marketplace, and agree to pay the assigned transaction or processing fees (“Afflishop fees”) in exchange for the services provided by Afflishop, currently, the Afflishop fees are as follows:</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83e4f"><strong>For affiliates:</strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83e69">All affiliates are required to register on Afflishop with N10,000. This sum of N10,000 is a yearly, non-refundable fee for affiliate maintenance paid to Afflishop. Afflishop has the rights to debit each affiliate of this sum once in a year.<br><br><strong>For vendors:</strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83e80">All vendors are required to register on Afflishop with N25,000 to start selling their products. This is a yearly, non-refundable fee. Afflishop has the rights to debit each vendor of this sum once in a year, plus Afflishop will also charge a commission of 10% per sale on all vendor products, these Afflishop fees can be changed at any time, and vendors and affiliates will be notified.<br><br><br><strong>Payments to vendors/affiliates:</strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83e9d">Except as provided below for first affiliate sale reserve, high-volume sales, or fraud investigation reserve, affiliates will be paid their commissions once in a week and vendors will be paid twice a month.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83eb8">Currently, affiliates and vendors can receive payments via any Nigerian bank account, and Afflishop is constantly working to offer new payment methods. Affiliates must have a minimum of N5000 in their Afflishop balance to qualify for a weekly payment.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83ecf"><strong> </strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83ee7"><strong> </strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83f00"><strong>Affiliate first-sale exception:</strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83f1b">Affiliates will not receive commission from their very first sale for each product they promote. this is to prevent the incentive for affiliate ‘fraud’ where an affiliate plays the system by granting themselves an instant discount (in the form of their affiliate commission) by purchasing a product through their own affiliate link. Afflishop wants professional affiliates who provide a legitimate service to the vendors, and their own customers, in addition to Afflishop. From the second sale onwards, affiliate commissions will be registered as usual. If you believe that, as an affiliate, you will only generate one sale per product promoted, you must not sign up as an affiliate.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83f39">However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume spike or any specific transaction triggering our security filters, Afflishop reserves the right to hold credits beyond the standard 10-day period subject to Afflishop’s manual investigation of the account's recent activity. This generally will only take a few days, however Afflishop reserves the right to reasonably extend the reserve period for a time sufficient to resolve its questions about unusual activity to its own satisfaction.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83f53">Afflishop endeavours to keep its reserves/holdback of processed payments as low as possible, and to generally release funds to vendors/affiliates within 10 days from the sale.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83f6d">However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume spike or any specific transaction triggering our security filters, Afflishop reserves the right to hold the credits beyond the standard 10-day period until a system administrator manually investigates the account's recent activity. This usually shouldn't take more than a few days.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83f87"><strong>Fraud investigation reserve period:</strong></p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83fa4">If Afflishop or one of Afflishop’s payment processors becomes aware of actual fraud, or suspected fraud in connection with any purchase or group of purchases related to your account, Afflishop reserves the right to require a fraud investigation. If such an investigation is required, any and all earnings/commissions earned on any basis may be temporarily held pending the investigation, whether or not connected to the actual or suspected fraud. Afflishop will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the fewest potential earnings/commissions held, based on its review of its risk. Such fraud may be in connection with debit cards, traffic, tracking, or some other basis.<br><br>If a fraud investigation is initiated, the vendor/affiliate may be asked to provide additional information. You agree to cooperate with any such fraud investigation in a reasonable manner. You will be informed of the results of the investigation, and a full accounting will be provided regarding your account and any earnings/commissions due.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83fc0">Any vendor/affiliate that has actual or suspected fraudulent activity associated with one or more otherwise creditable or commission-earning sales should not assume that Afflishop suspects them of fraud. Stolen debit cards, fake debit cards, and other scams are prevalent on the internet and such activity may have nothing to do with the vendor/affiliate. Nonetheless, you understand and agree that you cannot be paid for an otherwise creditable or commission-earning sale, where Afflishop will not be paid. Moreover, Afflishop will comply with all legal requirements and will report all such activities to appropriate authorities. If a vendor/affiliate is believed to be directly or indirectly involved with fraudulent activity or attempted fraudulent activity in connection with the Afflishop marketplace, Afflishop will pursue all available legal action against the vendor/affiliate. In such circumstances, you agree that you will forfeit any balance in your account, and that Afflishop may use any such funds to partially or fully defray its costs of its investigation and any subsequent action, including legal fees and costs.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd83ff5">Affiliates signup and maintenance fee: N10,000/year</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd84012">Vendors signup and maintenance fee: N25,000/year</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd8402f">Plus Afflishop will charge a commission of 10% per sale on all vendor products.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd8404c"><br>Funds generated from vendor/affiliate will be released about 3 days after the refund period has expired. So, once those funds are indeed released, you will be paid.<br><br>If there's any unusual activity detected on your account, or if our security filters are triggered, the reserve period may be increased while an administrator reviews the account's recent activity.</p><p data-css="tve-u-165ddd8406b"><strong>9.
